  - The gallery will be a responsive and interactive gallery that will feature a rollover animation. Following the gallery is a small section that shows the user the opening and closing times of the venue and a small contact section. 
  - The gallery has a hover effect where the images will turn grayscale when hovered over with the mouse. I got this idea from a project I saw on [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/trending).

## Testing 

While testing throughout the project iI ran into a few bugs that I managed to resolve myself.

- Center Align
  - I had some trouble at the start of the project with getting the navigation to center align, but I think this was purely because I didn't understand the correct code.
- Errors that occured when using validating code.
  - A few minor errors that were easy to fix on the booking form. 
      - Adding a min and max value for a text box. not needed removed.
      - Adding fixed value to a textarea box. Removed and targeted in CSS 
  - Using width % value on iframe. Tageted in css and style appropriately. 
  - Duplicate IDs used on one page. Chaned them to classes instead
  - Using a H5 element within a table. Removed and used em element. Targeted in Css and styled appropriately.
  - Some minor fixes when using the table data and table rows elements. Removed images from inside the table that were causing errors.
  - Improper use of Aria lables - removed
